## Welcome to the Civil Justice Data Commons GitHub!

The Civil Justice Data Commons ([Website](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/tech-institute/initiatives/georgetown-justice-lab/civil-justice-data-commons/)) is a joint project between Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy's Massive Data Institute ([GitHub](https://github.com/georgetown-mdi)|[Website](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/about-mdi/)) and Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Technology Law & Policy ([Website](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/tech-institute/)). 

The Civil Justice Data Commons (CJDC) aims to create a secure, robust repository for civil legal data gathered from courts, legal service providers, and other civil law institutions. You can access the repository on Redivis ([Redivis](https://redivis.com/CJDC)).

This GitHub is part of our Knowledge Base ([Website](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/tech-institute/initiatives/georgetown-justice-lab/civil-justice-data-commons/knowledge-base/)), a collection of resources for anyone looking to research using court data.
